## Scabies transmission model

This model is a modified version of household structured disease transmission model from Geard et al. [The effects of demographic change on disease transmission and vaccine impact in a household structured population](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175543651500081X). Epidemics, 13:56--64, 2016.

The model is calibrated to scabies transmission in Monrovia, Liberia to evaluate the effectiveness of mass drug administrations to reduce the burden of scabies. The preprint is available online at: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.16.22282431v2
