# simodd-dis-scabies

This is a modified version of simodd-dis from Geard et al. [The effects of demographic change on disease transmission and vaccine impact in a household structured population](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175543651500081X). Epidemics, 13:56--64, 2016.


The code is modified to include:

-introduction of SIS model, 
-using Prem contact matrix in community transmission, 
-systematic noncompliance in an intervention,
-systematic nontreatment,

While data folder includes Liberia-specific data, disease transmission coefficients (calibrated to Monrovia population) are provided in the output folder.
